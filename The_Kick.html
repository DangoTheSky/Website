            <br><p>The Kick is a short animation featuring two humanoid figures. 
                One figure is sneaking up to the other figure before initiating a 
                kick that sent the other figure to space. This animation is a prototype 
                that is submitted for an art project, where this project was meant to learn 
                basic animation in Blender such as creating a human figure using mesh modelling, 
                keyframing, posing, and positing of the extra elements. Though Daniel has some 
                previous experience with Blender, it was only mainly modelling and sculpting.
