            <br><p>The Kick is a short animation featuring two humanoid figures. One 
                figure sneaks up to the other before initiating a kick that sends the 
                other figure to space. This animation is a prototype submitted for an 
                art project, which was meant to teach basic animation in Blender, such 
                as creating a human figure using mesh modelling, keyframing, posing, and 
                positing the extra elements. Though I have some previous experience with
                 Blender, it was only mainly modelling and sculpting.
                <br><br>
                In creating the human figure, I followed an outline of a human figure. 
                Then, I would go through a process of rigging the figure using Blender's 
                Rigify. It took a while to fix up the rig for the pose, and after finishing 
                the rig, I detached and reattached the limbs to see what the effect was. 
                I determined having the attached limbs works best. In the end, I would finish
                 the sculpting and the rigging. I would quickly set up a scene and then animated
                  it to the final result at the top.
