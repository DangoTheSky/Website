            <br><p>Daniel Ounalom is a Media Arts student and 
                artist who focuses on building the skills and 
                practices in his line of work to pursue a career 
                creating worlds that people can live in without 
                physically residing in. Whether creating video games 
                inside of Unity or creating short animations inside of 
                Blender, Daniel wants the audience to question and critique 
                societal issues in our present reality while not breaking 
                the immersion that the audience is experiencing inside his 
                narrative-driven worlds.
