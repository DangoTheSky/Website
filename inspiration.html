            <p>1. The Value Corporation was one of the most pioneering game development companies
                 throughout the late 90s and the 2000s. Each single-player game they created and 
                 published would become a masterpiece and redefine the principles of the video game 
                 industry. 
                 <br>
                In their Half-Life: 25th Anniversary Documentary and their Half-Life 2: 20th Anniversary 
                Documentary, they talked about the methodologies to keep the player immersed in the games 
                by creating atmospheric audio by balancing periods of high tension and low tension, allowing
                 players to control themselves during sequences, and pushing the graphical and physics technology.
                  The best methodology is their player-centric design, which focuses on making the in-game 
                  interactions feel intuitive, alive, and responding to the player's actions. This methodology 
                  inspires me to focus my designs and practices on systems that focus on players' interactive 
                  environments, allowing them to feel immersed in these environments and that the worlds are 
                  alive and lived in.<br>

            <br><br>2. The Blender Foundation pushed the capabilities of its Blender Studio by showcasing the 
            technologies and capabilities of its own Blender. Each of their animations also aligns with my
             aspirations in my work in Blender.<br>
            Their animations inspire me through their dedication to creating meaningful short narratives 
            that can be expanded into full-length feature films. For example, their animation 
            "Sprite Fright" showed a retro-inspired horror comedy based on teenage campers meeting
             mushroom people. This animation showcases Blender's ability to create a straightforward, 
             stylized style and character designs and shows Blender's readiness for grand productions.
              Each project motivates me to explore each technology and use it in potentially breathtaking 
              visual experiences <br>

            <br><br>3. Steve Cutts is an animator and illustrator known for his satirical work,
             which highlights issues related to consumerism, environmental degradation, modern 
             life, and human nature in general. His ability to evoke striking metaphors represents 
             our way of life. For example, his animations can amplify the messages, especially in "A 
             Brief Disagreement." While the animation is fast-paced, it creates a millennium of conflict
             that stems from a brief disagreement on who owns the gold but quickly leads to a war of hate. 
             <br>
            His unique hand-drawn animation style inspires me as it demonstrates striking visuals that can 
            leave a lasting impression on the audience. The story creates a simple narrative with small 
            details to create and simplify complex messages of the issue at hand. I want to connect similar,
             more minor details for the audience to search in my worlds and potentially tell them a more 
             profound meaning with visual storytelling. Using metaphors and minimal dialogue can convey 
             compelling messages that evoke various emotions from audiences and let them critique these 
             messages.<br>
