            Learning new skills and creating new art 
            forms using these skills drives my practices as an 
            artist. This process helps me establish who I am as
             an artist and what style defines my practices. At 
             the end of this process, I could pursue my goal of 
             creating the worlds I always wanted to make. 
            <br><br>I always ask myself, "Does the Audience 
            understand my message in my worlds, and what areas 
            should I improve to achieve my end goal." These 
            questions should be able to keep me trying to 
            improve my processes and practices regarding what
             kind of artist I am.
            <br><br>Currently, I am expanding my skills and 
            knowledge in two distinct mediums: Unity and 
            Blender. Inside Unity, I want to use the software 
            to create interactive digital worlds that allow 
            people to question both issues without breaking 
            the immersion inside these games. Inside Blender, 
            I want to use the software to develop narratives 
            following a character that would also ask both the 
            issues in the animation and reality.
